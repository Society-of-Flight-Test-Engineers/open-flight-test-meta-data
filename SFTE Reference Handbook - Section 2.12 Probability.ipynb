    "When performing a test hazard analysis (THA) in preparation for a flight test, we examine the potential hazards associated with a given system, the probability of that hazard occurring, and the severity of the hazardâ€™s outcome. Engine failure is one such hazard.  In this case, we normally express the probability in terms of number of engine failures per million hours."
